Some ideas I've had

Research System:

1) Basic Research Building
  1A) Building can hold X researchers
  1B) Researchers are bought at an increasing cost (linear)
  1C) Research Buildings are bought to increase capacity increaseing cost (linear)
  1D) Better research buildings are unlocked at key points
    
2) Mech Command/Commanders
  2A) Mech Command is unlocked once a trigger point is reached (should be nice and early)
  2B) Mech Command has 1 free slot for a commander
  2C) Commanders are hired from the market, they have a purchase price and an upkeep rate
  2D) The 1st commander is given for free (still have to pay upkeep)
  2E) Commander Skills increase with xp earned from battles/training
  2F) Commander skill level determines army size and other bonus
  2G) Mech Commander Upgrades
    2G.1) War Room - Required to do missions (doesn't need upgrading?)
    2G.2) More Living Quarters for more commanders (exponetial cost)
    2G.3) Training Room, Upgrades to increase max amount of training per day (exponetial cost)

3) Mech Hangers/Mechs (the reason we are all here)
  3A) Mech Hangers store mechs bought from the market
  3B) The first mech hanger is free, after which they cost goes up (exponetial(sp?)
  3C) Mech Hangers can be upgraded to store more mechs or more hangers can be bought to increase capacity
  3D) Mechs
