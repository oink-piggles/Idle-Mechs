Some ideas I've had

Research System:

1) Basic Research Building
  1A) Building can hold X researchers
  1B) Researchers are bought at an increasing cost (linear)
  1C) Research Buildings are bought to increase capacity increaseing cost (linear)
  1D) Better research buildings are unlocked at key points
    
2) Mech Command/Commanders
  2A) Mech Command is unlocked once a trigger point is reached (should be nice and early)
  2B) Mech Command has 1 free slot for a commander
  2C) Commanders are hired from the market, they have a purchase price and an upkeep rate
  2D) The 1st commander is given for free (still have to pay upkeep)
  2E) Commander Skills increase with xp earned from battles/training
  2F) Commander skill level determines army size and other bonus


3) Mechs (the reason we are all here)
  3A) meow
  3B) Mech Bays are bought for storing mechs bought from the market (we don't build our own)
  3C) The 1st mech bay is free, after which they cost goes up (exponetial(sp?)
